# Project Proposal

Describe in about a page the project you want to do. Include as much detail as
you have right now. The purpose of this assignment is to have you think through
what it is that you want to do, what it is going to take, and what you can get
done by the end of the semester.

You have seven weeks to complete the project.  I expect an effort
approximately equal to all of the homeworks combined, so make sure that your
project is sufficiently ambitious.  DO NOT leave this until the last week.

To help you stay on track, you should have at least something that will compile
and run by Thanksgiving for me to review. The projects should be ready for
final review by the last week of class.

The last class period will be "Show-and-Tell". If your project is complete,
the idea is to do a ten minute presentation to the class to show what you
built. This activity is optional, but highly encouraged, especially for grad
students.

If you are writing a graphical front end to a simulator or data analysis
program, make sure that you don't bite off more than you can chew as far as the
"physics" are concerned. The same is true for writing a game. Concentrate on
the graphical end of it, not making the game elements do clever things.

It is very important that you make clear what you will definitely do, and what
you will do as time allows.  I am basing my judgement of the sufficiency of
your proposal on what you will definitely do, and will hold you to that in the
final submittal.

Let me know what your stretch goals are.  If your proposal is not sufficiently
ambitious, I can use that to suggest which of the stretch goals you should
commit to do.

PLEASE REVIEW MY FEEDBACK ON THIS ASSIGNMENT. If your project is not
sufficiently advanced, I will let you know in the feedback.

The following is a sample project description:

I will create a project that will allow the user to build obects using toy
blocks like LEGOs.  I will use the example Lego code as the starting point, but
improve on it by adding additional types of block such as wedges and ramps,
wheels, transparent blocks and lego men.

I will create all the blocks in code.  I will use textures to add detail to
the blocks and men.

The program will allow the user to choose the type of block to place from a
menu, and place the blocks using the mouse, and also move existing blocks.

I plan to have the different types of blocks created by the progress report.  I
then plan to build the program logic to construct the objects, and work on the
logic to move and place objects.  By the project review I will have the logic
to place and move blocks implemented.  As time allows I will implement additional
features like undo.
