Assignment 1: Gears

Download the gears program and run it on your system. This is to verify that you have a working

Submit via moodle:

1) The frame rate reported by the program when the window is different sizes,
specifically 1x1, 300x300 and full screen. Explain your results.

2) On some systems the frame rate is a small round number like 60 or 72 or 85
frames per second, and sometimes it is a large number, thousands or tens of
thousands of frames per second. Explain why this occurs.
