# Assignment 6: Lighting and Textures

Write an OpenGL program that incorporates both lighting and textures to create
a a scene consisting of textured solid objects that can be viewed in three
dimensions under user control.

The use of GLU and GLUT objects are prohibited to give you experience in
determining texture coordinates.  (GLUT objects do not support texture
coordinates anyway.)

Choose your textures carefully considering the scale at which you will apply
them.  The textures should complement the scene.  All objects in the scene
should be textured unless there is a very good reason not to apply textures to
some objects.

Use textures that are sized as a power of two, even though it may not be required,
because sometimes it makes a difference.  Also keep your textures small.  Textures
greater than 512x512 are rarely justified.

What to turn in:
1) Source code, makefile and readme;
2) Approximate time spent on the project.

This assignment is the last in the series. The academic value is to give you
some experience in using textures, lighting and three dimensional viewing to
visualize a scene that is quite realistic.
